sdesc: "Utility to transform bitmaps into vector graphics"
ldesc: "Utility for tracing a bitmap, which means, transforming a bitmap into
a smooth, scalable image. The input is a bitmap (PBM, PGM, PPM, or BMP
format), and the default output is an encapsulated PostScript file
(EPS). A typical use is to create EPS files from scanned data, such as
company or university logos, handwritten notes, etc. The resulting
image is not jaggy like a bitmap, but smooth. It can then be
rendered at any resolution."
